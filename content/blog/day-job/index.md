## MathWorks

I'm currently a senior consultant at MathWorks helping people to: develop computer vision and [[deep learning]] algorithms, write better MATLAB code and embrace good software development practices, develop and deploy more complex application than your average MATLAB user usually thinks about.

As part of my job I've been able to release some open source projects:

- [[matlab-pix2pix:pix2pix - Image to image translation with GANs]]
- [[matlab-mtcnn:MTCNN - Deep learning face detection]]
