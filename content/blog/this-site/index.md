I've had many different versions of a home page over the years. I've left traces on lots of different social media sites (but only really use Twitter now), kept a food blog, posted about [[generative art]] on a wordpress blog, even written [my own simple static site generator](https://github.com/justinpinkney/sissigen) (for no apparent reason).

This is my latest attempt (and I'm sure it'll stick this time, honest...). Hopefully this will be a place for me to share some of the more interesting things I make and do and even if it's not much interest to anyone else, hopefully I'll like it.

The site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and will give me somewhere to play with web technologies and learn a little more JavaScript and React. I've enjoyed seeing some of the recent activity around digital gardens and the indie web and hope to incorporate some of those ideas here too.
