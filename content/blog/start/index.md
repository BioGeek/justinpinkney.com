# Hello!

I'm __Justin Pinkney__ and this is my home (or maybe my [[garden]]) on the web.

Most of the things on this website are either about [Generative Art](../generative-art/) or [Deep Learning](../deep-learning/) or the combination of the two.

My [[day-job:day job]] is as a software consultant at MathWorks in the U.K. I spend most of my time writing code, developing algorithms, training models, and encouraging people to embrace good software development practices.

I work on lots of [projects](../projects/) both personal and work related.
