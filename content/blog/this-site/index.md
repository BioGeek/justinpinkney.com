I've had many different versions of a home page over the years. I've left traces on lots of different social media sites (but only really use Twitter now), kept a food blog, posted about [[generative art]] on a wordpress blog, even written [my own simple static site generator](https://github.com/justinpinkney/sissigen) (for no apparent reason).

This is my latest attempt (and I'm sure it'll stick this time, honest...). Hopefully this will be a place for me to share some of the more interesting things I make and do and even if it's not much interest to anyone else, hopefully I'll like it.

The site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and will give me somewhere to play with web technologies and learn a little more JavaScript and React. Under the hood I'm writing posts in MDX so I can include slightly [[trying-leaflet:more interactive content]] that in plain old markdown blogs. I've enjoyed seeing some of the recent activity around digital gardens and the indie web and hope to incorporate some of those ideas here too.

## Making use of these great things

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) - for writing posts
- [MDX embed](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed) - for embedding tweets and other things
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - for [[trying-leaflet:displaying big images]]
- [gatsby-plugin-react-leaflet](https://github.com/dweirich/gatsby-plugin-react-leaflet) - for working with leaflet
- [Littlefoot](https://github.com/goblindegook/littlefoot) - for foot note pop overs[^littlefoot]

[^littlefoot]: Getting Littlefoot to work correctly on the Gatsby production build actually requires something a little different to that described in the readme, see [this issue](https://github.com/goblindegook/littlefoot/issues/338).
