# Hello!

I'm __Justin Pinkney__ and this is my home on the web.

Most of the things on this website are either about [[Generative Art]] or [[Deep Learning]] or the combination of the two.

My [[day job]] is as a software consultant at MathWorks in the U.K. I spend most of my time writing code, developing algorithms, training models, and encouraging people to embrace good software development practices.

I work on lots of [[projects]] both personal and work related.
